## General service
### Contact options
My prefered methods of communication, in descending order of preferance and speed of response:
  1. Telegram

### Etiquette
If you decide to commission me, I kindly ask you to keep it to the point.
Please DON'T:
  - Smalltalk
  - Roleplay
  - Ask for personal information
  - Gennerally make things uncomfortable for me
  - Keep messaging me (Multiple times in short timespan) about the status of the commission
  - Insult me
  - ...
  
If you do this, depending on the severity of the situation, I WILL CANCEL the commission and put you on my blocklist, Which will deny you from getting any future commissions from me indefinitely.


## Prices and Payment
### Extra notes on prices:
  - Prices are noted as minimum.
  - The price may be higher on complex commissions. (See below for more information)
  - No free art and requests! Only when I specifically state so otherwise.

### Things that might cost extra
  - Character having many colors and patterns
  - Extra limbs
  - Detailed wings (Namely with individually drawn feathers)
  - ...

### Note on requesting for changes
You get 5 changes* free of charge (Before the commission has been marked as finished). I will impose an extra fee for each change* when you exceed the limit.

One "Change" means: A request to change parts of the drawing every time I send a WIP


### At which stage do I pay?
I ask you to pay BEFORE I start sketching.

Down payment is possible, but you HAVE to pay in full in the end if you want to see the final image. 

If you chose for this, I will use heavy watermarking in the mean time.


### Payment methods
  - If you live in the Netherlands: You can chose payment with 'Tikkie'.
  - Otherwise I can only accept PayPal.
  

### Refunds
If, for whatever reason you're not happy with the commission (Or it got canceled) , I can offer a partial refund.
Depending on which stage I'm at, this is what I can give back:
  - Rough sketch: 60 to 90%
  - Cleaned sketch: 40 to 60%
  - Color: 10 to 40%
  - Finished: Sorry, No refund on finished work!

Please, be aware that drawing can be very hard and time consuming, I always try to do my best and to make others happy with their choice.

HOWEVER, If you chose to do this, I may deny further commissions from you in the future.

These percentages will be higher if I can not continue myself, for any reason.
