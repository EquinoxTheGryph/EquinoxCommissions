# TOS (WORK IN PROGRESS!)

## Payment
### At which step do I pay?
I ask you to pay BEFORE I start sketching.
Down payment is possible, but you HAVE to pay in full in the end if you want to see the final image. If you chose for this, I will use heavy watermarking in the mean time.

### How can I pay you?
  - If you live in the Netherlands: You can chose payment with 'Tikkie'.
  - Else: I can only accept PayPal.

### I am not happy and I want my money back!
That's sad to hear :(

Depending on which stage I'm at, I can offer a partial refund.
  - Rough sketch: 60 to 90%
  - Cleaned sketch: 40 to 60%
  - Color: 10 to 40%
  - Finished: Sorry, No refund on finished work!

Please, be aware that drawing can be very hard and time consuming, I always try to do my best and to make others happy with their choice.
HOWEVER, If you chose to do this, I may deny further commissions from you in the future.
